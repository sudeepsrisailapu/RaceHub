# RaceHub

Welcome to RaceHub!

RaceHub will be a web interface that will serve as a hub for those in the sim-racing and racing community. Users will able to view racing information across a catalog of games(news, car-setups, laptimes, etc.), as well as register for sim-racing events to compete against other racers.

# Goals:
- Event Registration for different types of events across different types of games
- Functioning leaderboard in which users can upload their lap-times, name, car-used and track to compare against other users based on race-class/track (GT3, Hyper-car, LMP2, etc.)
- Login and registration for users so they can sign up for events, and chat with other RaceHub users (chat functionality most likely later)
- Rotating event calendar so users can register for different events over a weekly/monthly basis
- Updating new and patch note information for different sim-racing games (if possible to pull live information from different sim titles)
